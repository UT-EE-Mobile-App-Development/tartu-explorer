## Features
* As a user I want to be able to select different tracks, so that I can choose the type of experience I get
* As a user I want to be able to see a picture of the place that i must find
* As a user I want to be able to get hints about the location, so that I am able to find the location if I cant find it right away
* As a user I want to be able to see information/statistics about already completed tracks, so I can see the location I have visited
* As a user I want to be able to select tracks that are close to me, so that i don't have to walk to the other side of the city to start the track
* As a user I want to be shown a radius of the location if I ask for it, so that I can find the location even if I cant find it just based on the picture
